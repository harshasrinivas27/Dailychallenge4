# Cyber Activity Risk Analyzer

## Name

Harsha Srinivas

## Registration Number

AP24110011613

## Description

This program checks activity scores of student login sessions and shows the risk level.

It does:

* Takes number of scores
* Takes scores one by one
* Ignores negative values
* Separates into Low, Medium, High and Critical risk
* Counts valid entries
* Counts ignored entries
* Applies filtering based on my register number
* Shows final report after filtering

The program uses the last digit of my registration number.
Because my digit is odd, all Critical risk values are removed after checking.

## Language Used

Python
